# How can UK/Founders to compete against Larger more competitive clients/markets?

With the Trumps administration actions against immigration and foreign individuals,
tech talent needs another stream to flow through. The UK and Europe could harness this
talent layoff. The Uk is in a good place geopolically and that will entice talent to come 
here.

One of the hinders of integrating quantum teach is the infrastructure issues to support quantum, the tax issues regarding,
energy challenges (energy is very expensive in the UK), lack of liquidity when listing (Uk has little access to capital
and lack of investors that can make large investments needed for listing. This makes it hard for companies to scale in the uk
(post series A/B)

Where a company lists isn't important per se, but that does show lack of confidence in the market they decided to ignore
(e.g listing in new york instead of london if the business was created in london)

Currently the UK is the best place for tech founders to start their business! It has the best early stage pre seed environent,
with london being the best in europe, with East Midlands and Scotland following up. Although VC funding has been down since 2021 boom
(even in europe), UK VC's still raise more the european counterparts.

To be a disruptive venture in the current climate, a company/product has to first get the customers then the money will follow.
For some ventures like deeptech, getting the excitement if vital since returns then to be a lot later in the future (due to research, laws, bureaucy etc)
This can sometimes be circumvented by releasing what is ready and of small purpose, so more time can be given to developing long term investments/products.
Having a strong team who has a growth mindset encourages debate and collaborative approach to problem solving. This, alongside
using AI tools from the get go when developing can really help a new venture. The following is also important:
- Creating a product that will be disruptive in the market it's going in (change how users behave, change how users think, change how users interact)
- Having strong sponsors
- Good Track record
- Speed of executions of ideas
- Deep problem thinking
- Patent strategy (if its even needed, sometimes an nda could be what you need and cheaper!)
- Checklists on what are the most risky parts of the business and how one would shove those issues
- Solid data collection strategy

## Inspiring Talkers

This conference focused on many woman founders, some which had similar backgrounds to mine:

- Angie Ma - Faculty
Background in PhD in physics, didnt like academia and wanted to be more commercial. At early 30's she came to this conclusion 
and utilised her network; she acquired many connections, such as even knowing the co founder of deepmind, which inspired her fascination in
AI which she followed through to now and which lead her to created Faculty.

- Dr Janet Bastiman: Chief Data Scientist at Napier AI
Spent her whole life in physics and adamant on the explainability of topics, not where you come from or who you are gender, 
race, political wise. She is on the board of Royal statistical academy and loves deep tech, statistics and math.

- Dr Elizabeth Rizzotti - Newcleo
Background in nuclear physics and worked at cern. She later worked in strategic consultancy and finance and then came back to physics after
her stint in those fields to create Newcleo. She focuses on radical empathy and encouraged an open minded approach to solving problems.
She mentioned how important it was to consistently upskill, especially in industry knowledge. She is a big advocate of outsourcing things that
can be replicable and focus on building things that are enriching IP. Microlearning is the most important thing!

- Irene jia - Level Zero Health
Background in Innovation design engineering, has created a bio tech company (deeptech), and has raised the highest pre seed investment of any woman 
ever in europe ($6.9M)!

## Soft skills In leadereship

In regards to tech leadership, there are a couple things mentioned that should keep leaders at the head of their game:
- Radical empathy
- Encourage open minded approach to solving problems
- Consistent upskilling and keeping up with industry knowledge
- Microlearning
- Build things that only enrich IP, outsource everything else!

## Everything is Quantum!

As the famous richard feymann stated, everything is quantum! There is a deep relation between cosmology and quantum compute.
TLDR: Quantum entaglement that happens at event horizon

IBM were the first company to create quantum computers and since then many companies have done research into this area.
The genereal industry trend underpins what is needed for quantum to become commercialise (database trends, chip acquisition)

Some of the best use cases we have seen for quantum is cryptography and simulating nature. 
There will be a future (and maybe sooner than we thought) where LLM will be interacting with quantum computers. For example, Quantum 
computers can quicken the speed of processing data needed to train the LLM (to speeds where is wasn't possible before), and LLM's can produce new algorithms
for the quantum computers to solve! A fascinating potential feedback loop! But many more opportunities are waiting for us!
Just like Anthonie van leeuwenhoek built the microscope in the 17th century and its now used in different applications, we took are now in 
the exploration phrase of quantum and seeing what we can use it for! Maybe in variational algorithms (e.g calculating the ground state of simple molecules is possible now,
but what about more complex molecules? the whole are of quantum chemistry is at our finger tips!)

One of the biggest issues in quantum computing is error correction (which is needed as quantum computing is very noisy)
Google just released paper (circa 2024) discussing how this can be done between quantum computer and high performance computer
through the creation of their superconducting processor, willow (see paper "Quantum Error correction below surface code threshold")

Not every problem will require a quantum compute though. Do you need exponentially scaling compute, do you need energy/resource efficent compute?
if so quantum computers + classical compute (heterogeneous compute) is the way to go! Its very rare you need 100% quantum compute at all times anyways usually only a fraction!
The best systems will probably be a hybrid system: an api connection, a scheduler on classical compute (CPU), the algorithm run on gpu/quantum compute (allowing faster clock rates).
This heterogeneous compute is still needed (due to the necessary real time compiling for error correction)

CPU drove moores law
GPU introduced heterogenous compute
QC is the next step in processing compute!

Current big/close connections in Quantum
- Rob Young (current connect)
- Ilyas Khan (Chief product officer of Quantinuum)
- IQ
- National Quantum Computer Center

Things to look into in Quantum:
- variational algorithms
- Richard feymann lectures surrounding quantum mechanics
- Quantum optics
- Einstein's space-time relativity

Quantum states can be represented by vectors in its simplified state (can't model noise), or density matrices in general description.


## Agents

Think of AI as a violin player, and an agent as an orchestra of instruments. The ideal situation will be LLM + reasons + agents.
